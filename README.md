# Waterbath-temperature-control-and-measurement-across-glass-tube-using-arduino
File "WaterBathAndTemperatureRiseAcrossGlassTube.ino" controls the temperature of water bath at the desired set temperature. Program on PID control has been imported from Electronoobs[1] and implemented herein for temperature control of water bath. 
First the whole system was modelled using the notes of Dr. Barry Johnson[2] and the system equations were used for finding the appropriate values of PID constants with the help of SIMULINK.
